## UI / UX

The website prioritizes a clean and simple design, catering to users of all ages. The goal is to ensure a user-friendly experience with clear and intuitive navigation, following established web standards such as a top navigation bar and a profile menu accessible via a profile icon/image click.

### Agile

I've adopted Agile methodology for project planning, using GitHub Projects as the tool. Within the [project](https://github.com/users/fsjavier/projects/3), I've organized work into Epics (Milestones) to group user stories. Each user story includes a title, description, acceptance criteria, tasks, and tags to distinguish between "must-have" and "nice-to-have" features. The workflow progresses from "To Do" to "In Progress" while working on user stories and finally to "Done" upon completion.
